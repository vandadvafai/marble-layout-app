# Automated Daily Trading System

## Project Overview
This project is an **Automated Daily Trading System** developed using **Python**. The system comprises two primary components:

1. **Data Analytics Module**: A machine learning (ML) model that forecasts market movements based on historical stock prices.
2. **Web-Based Application**: A multi-page **Streamlit** application that allows users to visualize market data, interact with the predictive model, and execute trading strategies.

The trading system integrates financial data from **SimFin**, a financial data provider, to analyze historical trends and predict future stock price movements.

## Explanation of Each File

### **1. Streamlit App Pages (app_pages/)**
- **`home.py`**: Displays an overview of the trading system and its functionalities.
- **`go_live.py`**: Allows users to select stocks, retrieve real-time data, and display ML predictions.
- **`trading_strategy.py`**: Visualizes different trading strategies based on ML model outputs.

### **2. Data Processing (data/)**
- **`raw/us-companies.csv`**: Contains details of US companies.
- **`raw/us-shareprices-daily.csv`**: Historical share prices of selected companies.
- **`processed/output.csv`**: Cleaned dataset after ETL processing.

### **3. Source Code (src/)**
- **`api_wrapper.py`**: Python wrapper to retrieve financial data from SimFin.
- **`ETL.py`**: Extracts raw financial data, transforms it, and loads it into the system for analysis.
- **`model.py`**: Builds and trains an ML model to predict stock market movements.
- **`trading_strat.py`**: Implements different trading strategies based on the ML model’s output.

### **4. Other Files**
- **`.env`**: Stores API keys and other environment variables (not included in version control).
- **`scaler.pkl`**: Pre-trained scaler used to normalize data before predictions.
- **`stock_price_predictor.pkl`**: The trained ML model used for real-time predictions.
- **`streamlit_app.py`**: Main script to run the Streamlit web application.

## How to Run the Project

### This program was developed using python 3.11.1 so please use this version!

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed, then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Also please download the datasets 'us-companies.csv' and 'us-shareprices-daily.csv' from SimFin
and paste them in `data/raw`.

### **Step 2: Run the ETL Pipeline**
Before using the Streamlit application, process the raw data by running:

```bash
python src/ETL.py
```

### **Step 3: Train the Machine Learning Model**
Run the following command to train and save the model:

```bash
python src/model.py
```

### **Step 4: Check if the API is working**
Create a .env file and paste your API Key the variable SIMFIN_API_KEY= your api key
Run the following command to check if the API is working:

```bash
python src/api_wrapper.py
```

### **Step 5: Start the Streamlit Web Application**
Once the data is processed and the model is trained, launch the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
